# Network Folders

A simple application for a quick navigation among network folders or files.

Works on Windows 7, 8, 10, 11. Still was not tested on Linux and MacOS.

Application has only Russian language interface. The English language will be added later.

The repository of versions below 1.6 were deleted, because of there were files with confidential information. I was trying to remove those commits, but it was much more easier for me just to recreate the repository.
